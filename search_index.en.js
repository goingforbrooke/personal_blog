a Github Action workflow to build \"universal\" Rust binaries that work for both MacOS chip architectures.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nIssue\nWith MacOS's new M1 chip architecture, there are now two build targets for MacOS: x86_64-apple-darwin and aarch64-apple-darwin. Rather than ask our users to identify their chip architecture on a product installation page, I prefer to have one binary that works for all installation targets.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nApple's happy path uses XCode, but detest using a vendor-specific GUI to ship software on each release. That leaves us with lipo, which ships with MacOS. MacOS Runners are expensive, but it's a good start.\nAlong the way, we need to notarize the binary with Apple so our users don't get a scary installation popup warning that our application might be malware.\nSolution\nThis Github Workflow creates two binaries, x86_64-apple-darwin and aarch64-apple-darwin and \"smushes them together\" with lipo. Then it signs and notarizes the resulting binary and bundles it into a .app that's ready to be installed. There are some other goodies in here, such as a minor SemVer bump and some build caching to speed things up.\n\nKudos\nCredit to Federico Terzi's blog post  on signing and notarizing MacOS apps with GitHub Actions.\n","id":"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/action-universal/","title":"Build and Notarize Universal Rust Binaries for MacOS"},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/actions-reflections/":{"body":"GitHub Actions came onto the scene four years ago with the promise of free Continuous Integration (CI) for public repos. I was eager to use it, but quickly found that the product was too young. Buggy UI elements and the dearth of community workflows made it more of a time sink than it was worth, so I left it with the expectation that the issues would be solved.\nPhilosophy\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nHanging over these issues was “the DIY tradeoff,” that is, what price do I pay for using someone else’s tools over my own? With libraries, I carefully weigh the cost of adding a dependency against the cost of writing it myself. On one hand, there’s the chance of getting something that just works without having to put in the work for it. On the other hand, I’ve outsourced a part of my creative process and traded deeper understanding (and satisfaction?) for convenience and speed. Some things, like cryptography, are best left to others, while other things, like cache files, are easy enough to implement myself. With that in mind, when I hire “mercenaries,” I’m careful to weigh their cost against their benefits, even when they’re free.\n\n“Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline…”\n\nGoals\nWhen Actions offered “the DIY tradeoff,” I assumed that, given a few years and a few piles of those sweet sweet Microsoft dollars, the kinks had been worked out. I had two use cases:\n\nAutomatically update and publish this blog when I push changes to it\nBuild and publish my Rust binary for three different platforms\n\nBash?\nIn my mind, GitHub Actions competes with good ‘ole Bash scripts, which I usually run via Python for comprehensive output checking when they get reach ten lines.  I try to avoid learning technologies controlled by companies because I’ll probably be around longer than they will. That feels awful, though, having to bring an interpreter into my CI/CD pipeline. I can afford those excesses on my local box, but throwing those practices into a charge-by-the-minute build server seems wrong. While GitHub’s not charging me for public repos, I like to learn skills and habits that work well in enterprise environments.\nActions: YAML\nThat brings us to Actions, which challenges my Bash-thon workflow with a seductively less arduous syntax.\n\nI’m not the biggest fan of YAML, but it’s a nice JSON alternative for mercurial configs that could use some comments. It really shines when there are only 2-3 layers of nesting, but any deeper than that leaves me pining for hanging braces. Matrices also draw my ire because they ask me to use variables in a context bereft of a debugger. These complexity problems compound when jobs are broken into separate files. After just a few days away from my workflows, they looked alien to me. That’s ok for a dedicated DevOps person working on a large team, but since I’m an army of one on these projects, I strive to keep everything hardcoded in as few files as possible.\nPretty Checkmarks\nMy favorite advantage over Bash is the interactivity of workflow steps. As each step finishes, these friendly little green check marks pop up.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nWhen something fails in a Bash script, I have to visually parse dense log output to find the line that created the error. That’s not problematic for a one-off script, but when my CI build breaks, I want to be pointed to the problem right away. Not to mention it’s plain fun watching the green checks populate in another window after pushing some code. Workflow runs follow the same principle, so it’s easy to diagnose which commit went wrong.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nThe problem with these check marks is that sometimes they lie. GitHub puts on a show of being up-to-date with workflow progress, but some steps get out of sync, particularly long-running ones. For example, this yellow dot kept spinning and never turned green while the timer continued to increment, despite the job being long done.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nAfter refreshing the page, the green checkmark popped up and the timer corrected itself.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nWhen steps fail, the dense log output makes me wish that I could pipe the output to grep, but instead, I end up copy-pasting to Vim.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nBroken Actions\nBeyond my YAML reservations and state issues, I hoped that I could stand on the shoulders of giants by letting premade Actions do the heavy lifting. GitHub’s Actions Marketplace offers a nice menu for finding Actions, but many of these are broken or outdated. Sorting by “Most installed/starred” narrows the results a bit, but stars aren’t a good indicator of viability.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nFor example, many resources recommend actions-rs’s Actions to build Rust, which looks to be in good repair on the marketplace.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nThe repo for actions-rs/rust-toolchain tells a different story.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nRunning the action works well enough, but its log output is riddled with deprecation errors. A good internet citizen would fork, update, and PR, but…\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nrust-toolchain is a wonderful replacement.\nAutomating releases seems like low-hanging fruit, but Action pages aren’t forthcoming with the release philosophies that back them. In the spirit simplicity, I wanted a release-on-push Action tied to the main branch so every merge to main would generate a new release. Generating release notes from PRs and commit messages looked cool, but I prefer to err on the side of simplicity for initial implementations. Not to mention the potential rabbit hole of needing to learn a new format for my commit messages.\nGH Release looked like my ticket, but I wrongly assumed that that tag gates could be disabled.\n\n“Typically usage of this action involves adding a step to a build that is gated pushes to git tags”\n\nI have nothing against git tag and git push --tags, but they’re easy steps to forget. Instead, if the GitHub version mirror’s Cargo.toml's version, then the workflow could later be enhanced with automatic SemVer incrementation.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nGH Release doesn’t offer an easy way to git tag, but Create Release does quite nicely. I wish that I had the decision information to start with Create Release before I wandered through the other release Actions.\nFinal Thoughts\nActions need the same scrutiny for maintenance and citizenship that libraries do. Unlike a function definition in an API’s documentation, you don’t know what an Action will do before you try it, and trying it involves a lot of waiting and refreshing between iterations. They aren’t as simple as they seem and I’d hesitate to add them to other projects.\nI’m happy with the results because I feel confident that my invisible cloud goblins will buy me more development time than it cost me to make them. That is unless they break before the “break-even point.”\nOverall, my feelings are best summarized by my mentor’s reaction to my tale. “Hmmm,” he said, smiling cheesily, “well at least it’s free.”\n","id":"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/actions-reflections/","title":"Reflections on Github Actions"},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/actions-unpractices/":{"body":"GitHub Actions has little the way of best practices, but here are some strategies that don't work.\nIssue\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nThere's no \"right\" way to do develop something, but some of my favorite languages and libraries declare their ethos up front, that I might build with their philosophy in mind.\n\nThe Zen of Python and Go Proverbs come to mind.\n\nWhile GitHub has guides for usage and security hardening, I haven't found documentation on best practices. In the mean time, here some are some strategies worth avoiding.\n\nStep Granularity\nYAML Control Flow\n\nStep Granularity\nI tried separating concerns by defining each thing-to-do in a discrete step. I hoped that this would make the CI/CD pipeline easier to debug and enhance, but found the opposite to be true.\nIn my code, I like to separate the decision about what to do from actually doing the thing. That way, if one of something fails, it's easier to find the fault. That means that we need to store the decision in a variable and use that variable in the following step. Variables in Actions don't persist between steps unless you load them into $GITHUB_OUTPUT, making shell the lingua franca of Actions. Copping out to Python could help here, but I'd hate to pay for pulling an interpreter into every CI/CD invocation. So, we regress to running shell commands and adopt the drawbacks of both shell and Actions.\nFor example, I wanted to fix a bug in FolSum’s CSV export where column headers were labelled incorrectly. The current version (on the main branch) was v2.1.0. I branched off of the development branch with git sw dev; git swc fix/export_headers, fixed the bug, and merged the fix back into the development branch with git sw dev; git merge —no-ff fix/export_headers. Normally, the pipeline would've incremented the minor version from v2.1.0 to v2.2.0, but I wanted it to change from v2.1.0 to v2.1.1, implying that the release change was a bug fix, not a feature.\nTo accomplish this, I needed a conditional step that uses the name of the last branch that was merged to dev. If it starts with fix/, then the patch version would increment. Otherwise, the minor version would increment. It begins with getting the name of the last branch merged to dev (thanks ChatGPT).\n\nThen I needed to use this branch name to conditionally change the version. To accomplish this, I could follow ChatGPT’s advice and do it in one step.\n\nThe trouble here is that run combines two discrete tasks:\n\nGetting the name of last branch that merged to dev\nUsing the name of the last branch merged to dev to increment the minor/patch version.\n\nEach step could fail, so I’d like to see a green check mark and the output of each step when I’m debugging issues. Otherwise, it’s just a Bash script that I can’t debug locally.\n\nIt might be possible to speed up the debugging loop by running Actions locally with act or self-hosted runners. I tried act for a bit, but gave up after running into compatibility issues with macOS or M1 chips-- I'm not sure which. I haven't tried self-hosted runners, but my initial findings suggested that they're not capble of building universal macOS binaries.\n\nGetting the merged branch name in a discrete step means that I need to make it available to the next step with outputs.\n\nThe key piece here is echo “🏷️=$(🪄)\" &gt;&gt; \"$GITHUB_OUTPUT”\n\n🪄 extracts the version from Cargo.toml\n🏷️ is accessible in later steps via ”${{ steps.👟.outputs.🏷️ }}”.\n👟 is the name of the step set by id, which is get_current_semver in the snippet above.\n\n\nThe v prefix is also removed.\n\nThe version extracted from Cargo.toml is later accessed with steps.get_current_semver.outputs.semver in the Commit minor version bump step.\n\nThis feels like a needlessly complicated export, which, applied to this issue, looks like this.\n\nAdding this change took an inordinate amount of time. With descriptive step names, I quickly found the step that needed to be modified, but needed to re-read the rest of the pipeline in order to understand the implications of this change. Debugging shell code's annoying enough on my local machine, but doing it through a web browser with spin-up delays made it much worse. Despite the work that it took to divide the original step, this code block's no easier to debug or enhance.\nYAML Control Flow\nThese shortcomings are exacerbated by YAML flow control, which adds a behavioral layer that's implicit rather than explicit.\nFor example, the project uses branch push triggers to kick off the build process. Different branch prefixes trigger different sets of tasks, but without implicit flow control, it's hard to keep these tasks from colliding. Branches that don’t match feat/* or fix/* should trigger a minor version bump while cicd/* branches should act like they're doing a minor version bump without actually doing so. They want to run on each commit and need to be reigned in by a smattering of if conditionals.\n\nI'm not thrilled with having these scattered about my code, but YAML doesn't equip us with if/case/match statements. This makes changes difficult, requiring me to re-learn my pipeline's quirks each time. I pay double for mistakes because I can’t run things locally to test them, not to mention the annoyance of tabbing over to my browser to hit reload on-that-thing-that-just-might-work-this-time.\nI considered separating these decisions into jobs so I could debug with snazzy visualization graphs. That would significantly increase the complexity of the pipeline by deepening into vendor lock-in, making more YAML whitespace issues, and pulling more of my debugging workflow into the browser. In private repos, these mistakes cost money.\nConcluding Thoughts 🎬\nIf I want to run locally and have control flow logic, then I should use a proper programming language to run shell commands. When I started building this pipeline, I estimated that I could build 80% of the functionality in 20 hours with a time-ROI horizon of two months. With more than 80 hours of CI/CD fiddling to reach the 80% mark, I wish that I had taken a different route.\nI expected that GitHub Actions would allow me to define a flexible build pipeline, but what I got was a Bash wrapper that runs on someone else's machine. Building out shell commands in another language (such as Python) seems wasteful, but the money lost on pulling in an interpreter would've been miniscule compared to the cost of the time that was lost. If I could go back and do it again, I'd cram as much as possible into one Python-fuelled step that I can debug and enhance locally.\n","id":"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/actions-unpractices/","title":"Un-Practices in GitHub Actions"},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/cicd-frameworks/":{"body":"Rusty options for CI/CD pipelines and why Xtask is best for complex pipelines.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nIssue\nWe want to automate the delivery of a desktop app to our users, but we don't have a pre-wrapped solution like Goreleaser to do that for us. CrabNebula and Shuttle have some pretty sweet offerings, but I'd rather put the work into a bespoke solution that'll outlast any company and always be free.\n\nIf anyone's wondering about build.rs, it's called before compilation for stuff like macro expansion.\n\nSolution\nOptions:\n\n🐚 Shell Scripts: Automate the commands that we're already running\n🐍 Python Scripts: Automate commands by calling them with Python\n📦 Cargo Make: Automate commands in building blocks\n🦀 Xtask Framework: Use Rust to write our scripts\n\nShell Scripts\nDumping shell history to make a script is nothing new.\n\nI get pretty fed up with dquotes and folow control after 25 lines, which is down from the 100 lines of forbearance that I used to be so proud of. Flow control isn't as bad as YAML (cough cough Actions), but I'm left wanting the features of a full-bodied language for things like logging and syntax checking.\nBuilding and testing software are long-running operations, so I feel like it saves time if we it get it right on the first try. These time savings compound when we consider the cost of fixing a broken pipeline. We might not update a project for six months, and when we return to it, even the most bulletproof CI/CD pipeline might be broken. In that sad, tense moment, when my mental energies are already depleted and my users are clamoring for a fix, deciphering shell scripts is the last thing I wanna do.\nCargo Make\nCargo Make's Makefiles improve on these scripts by breaking them up into discrete chunks. Combined with strong integration into IDEs like RustRover, it's a great solution for 95% of CI/CD problems. Since most of us have used Makefiles before, this is awesome for working with a team. I find it lacking for my use case because it's best suited for short, repeatable actions like checking for syntax errors. Longer operations are cumbersome to manage and we never get away from the issues inherent to shell scripts.\nPython Scripts\nWhat about snek? Python's a bit better, offering sane flow control and friendly syntax, but I don't relish the thought of a multi-language environment. Using libraries for Git and app signing often goes poorly, so I end up using Python to call shell commands and check if they failed. The upside is that it's much easier to parse command output and make decisions based off it-- no dquote nightmares or deeply nested if/then/do/fors. Since I'm using another langauge to call shell scripts, why not avoid the cost of a multi-language environment and use Rust to call them instead?\nXtask Framework\nThat brings us to Xtask, which super dope and a little cursed. Rather offer a language or batched scripting, Xtask hijacks workspaces. These are originally intended for large projects with smaller projects inside of them, but we use them to use a discrete binary for building our code.\nHere's FolSum before and after adding Xtask:\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nThis lets us use Rust to write CI/CD pipelines for folsum/ in xtask/.

There's an undue expectation that the simplest application has to have a snazzy frontend (probably written in ReactJS) or it's not legitimate software. My resume's littered with pandering to this sentiment-- so much development time lost to visualizing stakeholder value so my manager had a dashboard to know what we were up to 🤢.\nI Don't Hate GUIs\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nI don't hate GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), in fact, I love them. I deeply value the people who work on them— they make it possible for the fruits of my software to reach people who aren't comfortable with CLIs. I just don't love them. It's a respectable skillset that I haven't developed because I don't enjoy it.\nThat isn't to say that I don't get why people enjoy it-- it seems incredibly fun to think through a user's experience and design something that not only gives them superpowers, but is a pleasure to use. Beyond basic implementations, there's this aesthetic dimension where skilled UI designers think through fonts, styling, positioning, spacing, and color pallets with an artistic mindset. And that's really really cool.\n\nI fully respect GUI design as an incredible speciality apart from my own.\n\nTyranny of the Wireframe\nWhat I take issue with is the default expectation that if your application has a GUI, then it has to look incredible. This creates chasms between libraries, CLIs and GUIs with little sympathy for what lies inbetween. Instead of creating something in one of these chasms-- a CLI that only runs one command or a GUI that looks like it's from the 90s, we live in a world of REST-flavored state issues where users are frustrated by software that makes them feel incompetent.\nSettling for Mediocrity\nWhen a website doesn't load correctly or a button doesn't work, subtle delays in response time signal to my developer brain that something's wrong long before it fails. Meanwhile, non-developers are mired in a world of broken “submit” buttons and old data that conspire to convince them that they're “just not good at technology.” This separates users from the functionality that they crave, damaging trust.\n\nSo, why don't we settle for something less flashy and more functional?\n\nGreat swaths of developers eschew GUIs entirely, embracing the perspective that they'll never ship to a non-technical user. That's a legit stance to take, but it would be nice to have another option.\nLost Development Time\nHow many developer hours are lost to making dashboards and tuning elements that don't need to exist? In the case of the ubiquitous webapp, two interfaces are required— a well-documented RESTful API in addition to the frontend. Changes to one must reflect changes in the other, exponentially raising the time-cost of development.\nVisual Apologetics\nBefore showing my rough-hewn GUIs to non-technical folks, I mentally brace myself for the “oh, that's nice” moment when Zoomers think that I'm unskilled and anyone older gets XP flashbacks. The experience sucks so bad that I'd be mortally afraid to pitch it to investors.\n\nIt comes down to ego.\n\nI'm scared to make something that doesn't look like Facebook because I'm afraid that it'll make me look bad. Meta has teams of engineers and designers dedicated to its UI, but I feel held to the same standard on personal projects.\nHumble GUIs\nIf the project has the money and people for creating and maintaining beautiful UX, then I go for it. Otherwise, I dispense with the frills and focus on making something responsive that just works and builds user trust. That re-focuses my work on what I'm good at— making great internals.\n\nI don't make crappy GUIs. I make humble GUIs.\n\nWith good code modularity and documentation, I can count on it being easy to add GUI when I need it, or, even better, tapping someone else to do it for me.\n","id":"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/crappy-guis/","title":"My GUIs Suck and that's Okay"},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/digital-garden/":{"body":"Organized lists of stuff that I think is cool.\nPurpose\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nInspired by Gwern's blog, I want to make a place online for links that I think are awesome.

Given how strongly Github touts its Jekyll integrations, I assumed that the process would painless. Ruby proved me wrong.\nWoes of Ruby\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nJekyll’s quick start page belies the complexity of properly installing Ruby. It threw a bunch of clutter into my .zshrc and installed a bunch of non-standard tools on my machine. Keeping non-standard tools up to date was going to cost me more time down the line, and I still wound up editing HTML/CSS/JS on an unaesthetic theme.\nZola to the Rescue\nI swapped Jekyll for Zola because I already had Rust on my box and, hey, Rust makes everything better. GitHub suggests other Static Site Generators (SSGs) with existing CI workflows, but since I was going off the beaten path, I thought it better to double down on something fresh.\nCurse of the Secret Sauce\nZola comes with a pre-built workflow for publishing to Github Pages, but it has to fight with Pages’ secret sauce.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nThis is Github’s automatic publishing action for Pages, which isn’t defined in .workflows and likes to add itself to projects when repos meet one of the mysterious criteria that define a repo as a Pages repo. This meant that the output from my non-Jekyll SSG would be immediately overwritten by Jekyll’s ill-fated output from the pages-build-deployment Action. I navigated to my site’s URL, expecting to see a beautiful Zola-generated site, but found a bare HTML site.\nThese triggers aren’t defined in Github’s documentation and there’s a good bit of discourse about how they seem impossible to disable. The triggers seem to be:\n\nnaming a repo {{username}}.githhub.io\nsetting up Pages in the “Pages” tab of a repo’s settings\nadding a .yaml workflow in .workflows/ that pushes to the gh-pages branch\n\nRecommended Solutions\nTo disable Jekyll builds, GitHub recommends adding an empty .nojekyll file “to the root of your pages repo.” Initially, this didn’t work because .nojekyll needs to exist at the root of the branch that Pages deploys from. The secret sauce defaults to gh-pages, but adding .nojekyll to gh-pages won’t help because most SSGs blow away the branch's contents on each build. With Zola, I accomplished this by adding .nojekyll to static/ in the main branch, which delivered .nojekyll to the root of gh-pages. Still, the secret sauce paid it no heed and my site was soon overwritten by Jekyll.\n\nUpdate (25-1-10): Publishing to Pages from Actions instead of from the gh-pages branch is the preferred way to disable Jekyll builds.\n\nMy Solution\nTo fix the problem, I had to excise Actions from the repo.\nFirst, I ignored the recommendation to use Actions for “customizing my build process” in Repo -&gt; Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Build and Deployment. Instead, I restricted Pages to branch deployments.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nSecond, I disabled all Actions with the exception of workflows defined by me. Choosing “Allow goingforbrooke actions and reusable workflows” doesn’t stop the Pages secret sauce, so I allowed all of the repo’s workflows that match *. This is found in Repo -&gt; Settings -&gt; Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Actions Permissions.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nTakeaways\nWith that, I have a blog that automatically updates when I push to it. 🎉\nIf you’d like to use anything that I’ve built here, feel free to copy-pasta my workflow for automatically pushing a website. It’s Zola’s deploy action with the exception of changing zola-deploy-action to master. This prevents an issue in Zola.\nFinal Thoughts\nImage hosting may become an issue if Github isn’t happy about the number of screenshots that I’m including in my posts. I also groan a little each time I commit an image to Git when it should really be hosted elsewhere. An S3-backed hosting option like the one for WordPress would be great, but I get the feeling that I’ll need to code it myself.\nZola's been a gem so far with more features than I know what to do with. I’ve yet to explore nifty things like filtering posts by tags, search indexing, and automatic image resizing. The real upside is that I feel confident in my ability to extend the project with anything else that I could want.\nI wonder if I’ve taken my site design too far and created something that won’t appeal to a technical audience. I earnestly want to make a great web experience for my readers, but perhaps a basic HTML site without SSL would’ve sufficed.\nA rare counterexample to the principle of specialization: your site should never seem like it was made by communications people, and the best way to achieve this is for it not to be. This is something founders should continue to micromanage forever.— Paul Graham (@paulg) May 6, 2023 \nFor any Microsoft developers reading this, I appreciate what you’ve done so far and I’d like to see your product gain wider adoption so I can use it on enterprise networks in exchange for green slips of paper. The design concepts are solid and I catch glimpses of the simplicity that made (pre-acquisition?) GitHub wonderful. To love Actions, I need well-maintained Actions for popular toolchains.

Spoiler: egui's my favorite.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nIssue\nWithout a GUI, non-technical users can't use my software and give me feedback on application logic. That impedes the feedback loop necessary to improve my product.\nMotivation\nI used to solve this problem with Flask's HTML templating because it can be easily replaced with a ReactJS frontend as the project grows. In Rust, I'd like a desktop equivalent to the simple GUIs that other systems languages enjoy.\nGoals\n\n\n📐It should create a consistent experience on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu without platform-specific changes. WASM's a bonus because it offers the possibility of converting my desktop app to a web app in the future.\n\n\n🦀 I prefer pure Rust solutions because they simplify compilation and don't inherit the issues of libraries written in other languages. Not to mention it's kinda romantic having top-to-bottom Rust. JavaScript will be viewed with great suspicion because I'm sick of it.\n\n\n✨Above all, UI changes should be trivial so I can focus on what's happening behind the scenes.\n\n\nNon-Goals\n\n\nIt doesn't need to be beautiful because I'm willing to sacrifice much on the altar of simplicity.\n\n\nWeb apps don't qualify because they require writing a second interface-- the RESTful API. Each visual change requires code changes in two places, which takes time away from working on core logic.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n🧊Iced: Elm-esque retained mode in async hell\n🎁Tauri: Super wrapper for the ages\n💖egui: Simple, portable, and fun\n⚛️Dioxus\n🌳Xilem\n🗒️Makepad\n🛵Slint\n📚Additional Material\n\nIced\nIced offers a unique model-view-update creation experience that borrows heavily from the Elm framework. It offers a retained (as opposed to immediate) mode update system that encourages simplicity by eschewing callbacks. Visual updates are reduced to state changes triggered by enum \"messages\".\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nIt felt funky at first, but once I got used to it, adding buttons and changing the layout was incredibly simple. The trouble was the time that it took time to get there.\n\nOne of the main complaints that we get from newcomers to the library is that there is a lack of documentation. -- Héctor Ramón\n\nReading the code was fun, but it made Iced the most time-consuming duplication of my frontend.\n\nThe book is completely empty currently, so if you want to learn, then you have to read a bunch of code from the examples, which, most of them aren't too simple. -- Héctor Ramón\n\nIced was the best-looking library that I explored. The default shapes and colors for buttons and panes are simple and visually pleasing without intruding on the style of Windows, *nix, or macOS. Different enough to be distinct and simple enough to be friendly, the default look of Iced made my project look sellable. Any library can be made to look enough like anything, but the prototypes we show to customers and investors often sport a good bit of create-react-app.\nUsing layouts to precisely arrange elements was awesome, and not every library guarantees that ability. I expect I'll miss it dearly as the number of UI elements grows with the project.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nAsync programming is what drove me from Iced because it demands a high ergonomic price that I wasn't willing to pay. The function coloring problem makes it difficult for async code to play nice with sync code, which drove me to rewrite the core logic in async. A zealous measure, but it seemed like the best way to reclaim lost simplicity. The cost of the conversion came to light when I found how involved it was to add new features.\n\nAsync can be avoided by using Sandbox instead of Application to set up the GUI, but it seemed like everything cool in examples/ required the latter.\n\nThis had the side effect of forcing me to choose an Executor much earlier than I would've liked. Before Iced, I was happily coding along with channels, assuming that a GUI thread would be just another splash in the thread pool. Async constructs and channels could coexist peacefully, but simplicity demanded that I centralize control by attaching my core logic to the executor. That sufficed until it blocked WASM compilation targets. Channels, by contrast, needed only wasm-bindgen-futures to transparently \"fake\" multiple threads in the browser.\n“Not production ready” is written all over the docs, but Iced never crashed on me. It's a terrific library that deserves more attention than it gets, but I got the impression that adoption would drive me to contributing before long. GUI work don't sing to my passions, though, so I chose to part ways with gratitude and optimistic expectations. I fully expect to use it again in the future.\nTauri\nNot so much a GUI crate as a super-wrapper of sorts, Tauri offers an Electronesque \"platform webview\" that's easier on system resources.\n\nElectron's the webpage-in-a-box behind Discord, VSCode, Slack, Atom, and Skype.\n\nI hoped to paint some JavaScript over my Rust code and reap the aesthetic benefits of the web. The result would be a quick application that looked great and ran anywhere. I couldn't stomach going back to JavaScript, but the starter guide made for a fun intro to Sveltekit.\n\n\"Come for the Rust, but stay for the JS. It's a terrible claim, but basically, what we're trying to do with the API is lower the barrier of entry for people who want the safety guarantees of Rust and the very strict approach to access of the system assets that we can offer from Tauri.\" -- Denjell\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nThe Sveltekit intro tracks with the unparalleled docs that Lorenzo Lewis is making even better. He and the other Tauri folks had a warm presence at RustConf this year and their partner company Crab Nebula continues to inject love into the Rustacean community.\nDeveloper prioritization culminates in an inspiring CI ecosystem with deployment capabilities approaching that of goreleaser. My CI pipelines borrow heavily from Tauri's example.\n4 years ago today, Denjell &amp; Lucas, the co-founders of Tauri, wrote C++ for the last time and decided that @rustlang would be the foundation for what today is the most popular of all #OSS projects of its age on @github written in Rust:https://t.co/ZhrGKOJHAd pic.twitter.com/VsyMRwRXmu— Tauri (@TauriApps) May 23, 2023 \nMy biggest issue with Tauri was how much it slowed filesystem access. Compared to egui, it took far longer to count every file on my machine, probably due to the file access whitelist. It's an ambitious standard for security that I'd like to see in other projects, but I really want my Rust code to run unimpeded.\nResearching solutions got me lost in the world of Vite and other WASM-related stuff. It's fascinating reading, but too esoteric for the simplicity I crave.\nBy the end of my time with it, I felt that Tauri was focused more on being powered by Rust than being for Rust. The CI/CD, documentation, and explicit security were wonderful, but those conveniences weren't enough to justify mixing NodeJS into my project. Inspired by Iced, I tried Elm, but that fun little detour was a weird little Haskell-world unto itself.\negui\negui has my heart because it's incredibly simple and plays nice with all compilation targets.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nThe default look won't win any awards, but built-in graphs give us JavaScript-like visualizations that other GUI libraries are only beginning to add. A few tweaks to the global theme look pretty sweet pretty fast, but it's tedious to style elements in groups.\n\nBest of all, it has a dark theme! 🤯\n\nGiven the project's incredible growth over the last year, I'm confident that what doesn't already exist won't be that far off. Project churn in the Rust ecosystem has made it feel more chaotic than it is, but I could always count on emilk's benevolent care to keep egui alive as other crates fell into disuse.\nWhat egui doesn't have, I'm certain I could add myself. The simplicity you see in the API permeates the project. For instance, the code behind this hello world example.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nI left out the boilerplate because the meat of the GUI lives in update(). The immediate approach calls update() many times a second, completely redrawing the screen each time 🤣. All that is and all that do exists in one place.\n\nThose redraws add some CPU strain, but it's not a big deal if the GUI has its own thread 🧐. Mobile targets stand to suffer the most due to the impact on battery life. I'm hesitant to chalk this up to an intrinsic flaw, though, because optimzation, like animations, hasn't been explored yet.\n\nIf your GUI is highly interactive, then immediate mode may actually be more performant compared to retained mode. Go to any web page and resize the browser window, and you'll notice that the browser is very slow to do the layout and eats a lot of CPU doing it. Resize a window in egui by contrast, and you'll get smooth 60 FPS at no extra CPU cost. -- egui docs\n\nIt's fun to use cargo-tally to track adoption of new egui releases pic.twitter.com/O0WhoKnG7w— emilk (@ernerfeldt) November 16, 2023 \nThe benefit of barbarous rendering is a crisp response that few have touched since the programs of yore. Clicks register almost presciently, building trust. That is, if my user can ignore the mounting suspicion that they've downloaded a trojan.\nHere's how my project's looking with egui.\n\nLowkey the \"Summarize\" button doesn't work in WASM builds because I haven't added dummy files (yet).\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nLayout capabilities are egui's the biggest deficiency it intrinsically forbids the concept of a layout as we know it. Neatly proportioned panes aren't in the cards when you're tossing in elements from the top left to bottom right.\nEgui's incredibly portable, happily deploying to Windows and MacOS with no code or dependency changes. The WASM build above was a starter template serendipity and it'll even fit inside Tauri 🤯.\nThe README comprises most of the docs, though I needed little help beyond the starter template and a few examples.\n\n24-6-2 Update: There's now a suggested fix for fuzzy text, though I haven't tried it (yet).\n\nHonorable Mention: Dioxus\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nDioxus is gaining popularity with its React-style component update model. I haven't tried it yet because I'm weary of React's labyrinthine update propagations.\nThe project has incredible documentation and a thriving community that makes me want to procrastinate in GUIland even longer.\nHonorable Mention: Xilem\nXilem looks promising, but it's more idea than library. It aims to become Rust's definitive UI framework by incorporating lessons from SwiftUI and Druid, a popular crate that was discontinued in favor of Xilem. I'm excited to watch Raph Levien’s vision mature into an incredible developer experience.\n\nXilem unapologetically contains at its core a lightweight change propagation engine, similar in scope to the attribute graph of SwiftUI, but highly specialized to the needs of UI, and in particular with a lightweight approach to downward propagation of dependencies, what in React would be stated as the flow of props into components. -- Raph Levien’s\n\nHonorable Mention: Makepad\nLike egui, Makepad's an immediate mode contender.\n\n\"because there's always been this fight between 'how do you make a UI that is designable, and how do you make a UI that's programmable?\" -- Rik Arends @rikarends\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nIt offers a lot more flashy bits than what's on display here, and the ironfish synth is a blast to play around with.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nThe trouble here is that it's not production ready (yet).\n\n\"not production ready\" @JanPaul123\n\nHonorable Mention: Slint\nSlint has a nice look and seems to cater to embedded systems, which I hoped would translate to portability. The creators wanted to move on from Qt to mouse-driven UI modelling that could then be wired up to code.\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nI didn't give Slint a shot because it required money until recently. Maybe it deserves another go?\nhow weird is it that Slint's charging for a GUI library in a young language— Brooke (@goingforbrooke) November 14, 2023 \nConclusion\negui has my heart, but I'm eager to try Dioxus. Xilem might eventually come to save us all, but egui, iced and dioxus are the most viable bridges to mouse-land. 🐁\nAdditional Material\nThe list of Rust GUI projects on areweguiyet.com is regularly updated with new and archived repos. The merits of the most popular options are regularly updated on LogRocket's blog.\nIgor Loskutov's 50 shades of Rust offers code samples and thorough commentary on an incredible breadth of 50 libraries. A code-rich overview can be found in State of Rust GUIs. The code samples are getting out of date, but they convey the ethos of each library.\nThe performance comparision of Tauri, Iced, and egui offers an intriguing account of each approach's resource cost.\n","id":"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/rust-guis/","title":"Simple Rust GUIs for Desktop Apps"},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/versioning-version/":{"body":"Version bumping’s the gateway to a smooth CI/CD process and branch naming conventions make it happen behind the scenes.\nIssue 🧐\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nGit tags are a popular way to version software and trigger CI/CD pipelines, but they exist in VCS-land, a separate dimension from code. I usually forget to tag commits for the CI/CD pipeline, and even then I find myself routinely refreshing my knowledge of the difference between lightweight and annotated tags. If I manage to get those steps right without messing up the number, then I forget to add —tags to git push. At each step, the tags have the opportunity to get out of sync with the code base.\nMuch of this can be avoided with some combination of Git hooks, Git aliases, and client-side scripts, but implementations featuring these tools tend to be more stick than carrot. By the time I git push, my mind’s already working on the next step, and interrupting that process with a pedantic message pulls me out of the groove.\nSince I’m dumb, I need a system that’s smarter than I am.\nSolution 🪄\nCargo.toml furnishes us with version, and we use it as the source of truth, versioning the version to the delight of recursive wording fans everywhere. This integrates with the existing Cargo ecosystem and provides an escape hatch for CI/CD pipelines that use Git tags. It’s easier to create a tag from a file than the other way around.\nFeatures ✨ and Fixes 🪲\nMerging to the main branch triggers a release, which builds a macOS binary and decides whether to bump the minor or fix version. This decision depends on the prefix of the last branch that was merged to dev. If it was fix/, then the fix version’s incremented, but if it was feat/, then the minor version’s incremented.\n\nVersion Bumping ⬆️\nVersion bumps are performed with Cargo Edit’s cargo set-version —bump.\n\nI’m using the xtask framework in this example, so the eponymous binary source inside the workspace is specified with —package.\n\n\nUsing a crate to accomplish sed's job is overkill, but Cargo Edit’s useful later in the pipeline and moves us one step closer toward a self-contained bundling solution. Admittedly, it doesn’t provide a way to extract the version, so we have to fall back on the shell with jq.\n\nAfraid to Commit 💔\nThe pipeline then commits the SemVer bump in Cargo.toml to the main branch. I’m not a fan of this because (a) committing changes directly to main violates my merging practice and (b) introduces unverified commits into the repo.\na. In the first issue, we sacrifice form for function because the simplicity gained by breaking the rules outweighs the cost of having another (build) branch to keep track of. This comes with the burden of remembering to git pull the main branch before manually doing a major version bump.\nb. The second issue’s caused by the commit GitHub Action lacking a verification signature, which can be remedied by using a different action. Our threat model doesn’t require a column of pretty green “Verified” marks, but supply chain security’s a growing concern and I enjoy cryptographically stamping “mine” everywhere.\nFixing the Fixer 👩🏼‍⚕️\nThe cicd/ prefix plays a special role by offering a safe place to troubleshoot the pipeline itself. Builds and version bumps fire as if every commit was a merge to main, but only draft releases are created. These are invisible to users and won’t cause build failures if a release name already exists. This makes it easy to play with the pipeline out of band without soiling the user’s experience or blocking other developers.\nRoom for Improvement 📈\nThe pipeline’s core logic could be improved by appending the short commit hash to the end of the SemVer. Finding the merge commit for broken builds would be much faster and the pipeline wouldn’t fail due to a (SemVer-based) release name already existing. On the other hand, failing this way makes version bump flow control easier to debug by giving a plaintive voice to unexpected behavior. I’d rather fail to release than ship a mislabeled update to users. The latter’s hard to notice and harder to fix.\nCooperating with other developers under this model would also be difficult because there are no PRs or branch rules to enforce the feat/ -&gt; dev -&gt; main merge workflow. This is because I’m the only one on these projects and I haven’t gotten around to it yet.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nSince the pipeline runs on each commit pushed to cicd/ branches, too much learning or fixing could get expensive in a private repo. A self-hosted runner might alleviate this, but I haven’t bothered trying because I’m afraid that it’s not a faithful reproduction of GitHub’s environment. Even if I’m wrong in that assumption, I’d rather spend time migrating to Xtask.\nConcluding Thoughts 🎬\nLeaning on Cargo.toml keeps things simple and clean while keeping Ferris at the center of my galaxy. It’s awesome that I can key this capability off branch-naming conventions that I’ve already built habits for, but I don’t know well my bible sits in the hands of others. At its best, this model strains the capabilities of GitHub Actions due to poor flow control.\n","id":"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/versioning-version/","title":"Versioning the Version: Branch-Bumping Cargo.toml"},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/why-rust/":{"body":"Why did I choose a nascent, apocryphal language to do the thing?\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nWhy Rust?\nEmbarking on an end user project with Rust was no small decision, but I chose it because it's ideal for delivering to users on government networks. Not to mention fun.\n\nI'm building an ETL tool for law enforcement that puts messy data from search warrant returns into tables. Basically .* &gt; evidence.csv\n\nDelivering to Law Enforcement\nMy users support the public interest on aging thin clients that run a version of Windows about two versions behind. The last iteration avoided this with a serverside webapp, but the bureaucratic hoops required for a server and an SSH key were too arduous.\nTakin' it Old Skool\nThere's this legacy process, though, where you submit a binary to the security division for review, and, once it passes, they'll put it up on the internal app store!\n\nWho knew that you could deliver software this way? 🤯\n\nThe Fruit Company\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nThin Windows clients represent the majority of government machines, but the taste-makers in specialized investigative divisions tend toward Apple devices. It's tempting to build for these users alone because their machines are more powerful, less locked down, and sequestered to their own corners of the network. I can't stomach it, though, because I know that strategy would hamper the scope that I envisage. Conversely, ignoring these users would slow adoption and eliminate my most valuable feedback channels.\nBuilding for Apple has its own security hurdles, but what's more concerning are the UX expectations of users on their platform. Installations are quick, UIs are responsive, and there's very low tolerance for fiddling with security permissions. On the bright side, these are surmountable obstacles, which, once solved, will never become issues again. 😏\n\nApple and Windows it is then, with a consistent UX experience across both platforms. 🙃\n\nCloud?\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\nFor anyone wondering about a cloud solution, know that government folks are suspicious of things that don't run on their own hardware. There's been a big push for Azure adoption, but the security restrictions on these networks make it difficult to do installations, updates, and configuration changes.\n\nAs for GovCloud, I haven't found anyone who's managed to get their hands on it.\n\nDoes Every Platform Dream of Electric Sheep?\nGovernment software vendors include onsite personnel and a service contract with their hefty price tags, but my software's free, so I don't have the capacity to hire more brains or put mine on call. 🧠\nThat means that we need a multi-platform language that lets us make things to work the first time, and keep working, if we're to manage to delivering anything at all. On top of that, it's gotta offer a path to zero dependencies with high reliability and performance ceilings.\n\nWith a service running in a data center, you can roll back, fix, and roll forward at your convenience. But, when building software that users install, the cost of each mistake is higher -- \"Why Turborepo is migrating from Go to Rust\" on Vercel's blog\n\nThose lofty goals goaded me toward the walled gardens with varying degrees of success:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nPython 🐍\n\nThe Snek language implementation was quick 'n dirty, but I was jonesing for strong types past the 25k lines. While it's possible to wrap an interpreter into a Win executable, it's not incredibly straightforward and the resulting package is bulky. Performance considerations also come into account when I consider how difficult it would be to write a performant database and/or indexer on old hardware with Python. Dependencies could solve the technical problem, but a growing number of government shops will check them against known CVEs. With low severity CVEs receiving as much scrutiny as high severity ones, every import carries a sizable risk.\n\nJava ☕️\n\nThe JVM's great when you can rely on a recent (~6 years) version being available on your user's machine, but that's rarely the case. More importantly, the oldest version among all of my customers would become the floor for the others. I also have reservations about memory usage that stem from the -Xms and -Xmx nonsense that I encountered in my ELK wrangling days.\n\nC++, C#, Mono, and C 🏎️\n\nQuick and annoying, but getting a simple prototype onto multiple platforms wasn't a clean operation.\n\nRust 🏆\n\nThe Draconian syntax pays off by doing what I want it to do, as fast as I want it done, on every platform that I want it done on. The binaries are small, ask nothing of the OS, and zip onto my user's machine before they know that they've clicked \"install.\" The things that suck are problems that I'm willing, even excited to deal with because the actually hard problems of distribution and compatibility problems are largely solved.\nAnd hey, I've gotta admit, it feels pretty badass shipping to a legacy device that's built to run a browser. That is if this works, anyway, but hey, nothing risked, nothing gained and it'll be fun along the way.\n","id":"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/why-rust/","title":"Why Rust"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/action-universal/":{"body":129,"title":6},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/actions-reflections/":{"body":683,"title":3},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/actions-unpractices/":{"body":641,"title":4},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/cicd-frameworks/":{"body":373,"title":3},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/crappy-guis/":{"body":381,"title":4},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/digital-garden/":{"body":686,"title":2},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/golang-custom-install/":{"body":168,"title":2},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/pages-ssg/":{"body":518,"title":8},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/rust-guis/":{"body":1260,"title":5},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/versioning-version/":{"body":507,"title":5},"https://www.goingforbrooke.com/personal_blog/why-rust/":{"body":479,"title":1}},"length":12},"lang":"English"}
