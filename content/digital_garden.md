Inspired by [Gwern's blog](https://gwern.net/about#development), I want to make a place online for links that I think are awesome. If I'm successful in building this [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), then it'll be opinionated, weird, and disorganized. Maybe this [isn't a digital garden at all](https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/10/are-digital-gardens-blogs/). Anything too polished would be more [stock than flow](https://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890/), and might burden me with the appearance of agreeing with the content that these links lead to. Rather, these pieces of information are targets for synthesis.

> I've switch from Midjourney to ChatGPT for generating my header images. So far, I'm a little disappointed with how tame they are. They feel more design-by-committee rather than the zany and unorthodox monstrosities that sail out of Midjourney. For example, the image for this post looks more like a misplaced farmer's market than a library of ideas. I would've preferred something like [this](https://youtu.be/hLljd8pfiFg?si=5o0YAVc1DQGHZIXi).
