We think, “oh, my pre-teen, you may think that the drama with your boyfriend feels like the end of the world, but just wait until you have a mortgage and a jab. Then you’ll truly fathom the depths of stress and pain.” But what if we're wrong?

When we look back at what we thought were big problems in high school, they seem quaint. Rather than assuming that we’ve grown as people and gained greater facility in our person, what if we’ve only forgotten the magnitude of our past emotions?

The trouble is, we [tend to forget memories that we’re not fond of](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-22368-007). This makes us remember the past more rosily than we experienced it.

To extend the thought, I wonder if this could lie at the root of misplaced self-confidence. If we feel that we’ve “come a long way”, or, (egotistically, perhaps), “seen some s***” and thus gained wisdom, then we might act with more confidence in our sagacity than we actually possess.
