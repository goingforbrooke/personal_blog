Another paragraph.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A rare counterexample to the principle of specialization: your site should never seem like it was made by communications people, and the best way to achieve this is for it not to be. This is something founders should continue to micromanage forever.</p>&mdash; Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1654765304184971264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
